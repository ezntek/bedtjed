# bedtjed

a scuffed text editor (JUST LIKE JED [@jumps-are-op](https://github.com/jumps-are-op) HAHAHA) made to rival `jed` by Jumps-Are-Op.

## Why?

This is a schism of a text editor project as a result of a disagreement of code
style and the general direction of the project. Originally, Jumps-Are-Op and I
were going to collaborate on `jed` (coding in a pair is fun), but after
disagreeing on  general code style, formatting, naming conventions, patterns,
and the objective of jed, it was decided that `jed` would be forked to become
`dej`, the `not Dumb Edition of Jed`. However, it was soon discovered that
Jumps' code was way too unreable and made absolutely zero sense, like in the
specimen below:

It was ultimately decided to create a whole new editor, that does not force the
GPL upon all of its forkers.
